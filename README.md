## Workshop Series: Introduction to software development for High Performance Computing

### Instructors
Gerardo Hidalgo-Cuellar, Mea Trahan, Andrew Monaghan
Research Computing, University of Colorado

### Description:

Users of high performance computing (HPC) can greatly benefit from the ability to parallize computational tasks across 10s, 100s or 1000s of CPU cores, which an in turn can speed up simulations by orders of magnitude. Whether or not you are a software developer, learing some basic fundamentals of software development for HPC -- software version control, message passing between parallel tasks within software (MPI), and profiling & scaling software -- will facilitate more effective computing practices, and may come in handy if you need to make modifications to research code. 

This three-part short course will cover the following topics: 

1. __May 19, 2022, 3:00p-4:00p:__  _Software version control with git_: An introduction to creating, managing, versioning and sharing software repositories on Github.
2. __May 20, 2022, 10:00a-11:00p:__ A "quick start" guide to _profiling_ (systematically analyzing software to identify and address bottlenecks) and _scaling_ (iteratively running MPI software for different numbers of cores, or different problem sizes, in order to determine the most efficient configuration on a given HPC cluster).
3. __May 20, 2022, 1:00p-2:00p:__ _Fundamentals of MPI programming_: An overview of the basic principles that enable software to be parallelized. Examples will focus on the "c" programming language, though principles are broadly applicable so experience with "c" is not needed. 

While you may benefit most from taking all thre courses together, if your schedule is limited and you can only take 1-2 modules, each module will be designed to be as self-contained as possible.


### Prerequisites:

1. You will get the most out of this course if you have some experience using linux, high performance computing clusters, and some knowledge of programming.  
2. If you are from CU or CSU, register for a [CU Research Computing account](https://rcamp.rc.colorado.edu/accounts/account-request/create/organization).  If you are from another organization, some temporary accounts will be available.
